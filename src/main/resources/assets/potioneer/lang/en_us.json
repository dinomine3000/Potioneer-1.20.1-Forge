  "contents.potioneer.introduction": "Humans must depend upon a variety of potions to travel the path of supreme ascension. Each pathway begins at sequence 9, and the lower one descends, the stronger they become, rivaling even the Gods themselves. This is but a short introduction to the hidden world of Beyonders.",
  "contents.potioneer.formula_top": "Firstly, you'll want to find a fitting sequence 9 potion formula.",
  "contents.potioneer.formula_bottom": "Search far and wide for one that speaks to you. There are many sequence 9 potions.",
  "contents.potioneer.cauldron_top": "Once you have chosen to concoct a potion, you must create a dedicated potion cauldron.",
  "contents.potioneer.cauldron_bottom": "Make sure you use the right proportions of water, and light a fire beneath if needed.",
  "contents.potioneer.pathway": "There are plenty of pathways out there, and each one converges to their own level of power. Each has a theme, but they're all distinct.",
  "contents.potioneer.ingredients": "A formula's ingredients are broken down into 2 sections: main and supplementary. The resulting potion depends only on the main ingredients, but it can only be fully concocted with the supplementary ingredients combined. There is, however, a way to concoct a potion if you don't have access to the main ingredients...",
  "contents.potioneer.spirituality": "Beyonders cast abilities by consuming their spirituality. This is detrimental on the spirit, and lowers their sanity if they overexert themselves, but nothing a simple day-long rest won't fix. You can recuperate using Cogitation",
  "contents.potioneer.sanity": "Beyonders are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches, constantly fighting against dangers and madness. Their sanity is limited by the digestion of their characteristics, and if it's low enough they'll start taking damage.",
  "contents.potioneer.acting": "\"You don't 'grasp' potions, you digest them. Nor is it about 'discovery' but acting. A potion's name is not only symbolic, it is also Imagery. When digesting potions, it's key.\"",
  "contents.potioneer.advancing": "To advance, you must consume a potion of the following level to yours, but it must be of the same pathway as the one where you started. Attempting to 'switch' pathways will only result in immediately losing control and dying.",
  "contents.potioneer.mistakes": "It is possible to consume a potion and skip levels, though incredibly foolish and dangerous. If you have found yourself in this predicament, you won't feel as mentally well as you might hope for, but to fix that it's as simple as consuming the missing potions you skipped, you doofus.",
  "contents.potioneer.characteristic": "When a Beyonder dies, they have a chance of dropping one or more of their characteristics. These can be used as replaced for the main ingredients of a potion formula. Generally, you'll drop your last characteristic if you die with low sanity.",

  "contents.potioneer.charm_101": "To craft charms, you simply do a ritual to the proper existence. If their powers allow for it, and they so desire, it'll be crafted. The quantity of base material determines the duration of the associated effect, while the reputation and level of the target determines the level of the effect.",
  "contents.potioneer.appraisal": "The appraisal ability lets you see a lot of previously hidden information. Things like the pathway of an item, the downsides of an artifact, or whether a potion was correctly made, can be determined with just a glance.
